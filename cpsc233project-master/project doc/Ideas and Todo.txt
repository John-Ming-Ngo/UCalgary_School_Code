Todo: 
- What's up with the stock names/symbols? Is it possible to simply go with symbols only?

- Comment and brush up on code.

- Implement date pasrsing functions.

- Implement offline mode.

- Implement random mode.

- GUI

	- A graph of stock trends.
	- Pen and paper draft of the GUI.

- Better reporting (Trending)

- Performance data

Ideas:

- Implement buy/sell chances

- Add dividends/bonds?

- Implement quantity of stock the company has. I mean, if MSFT only offers 1 000 000 stocks and we have 1 trillion... I guess we own the company 1 000 000 times over...
