#This is a text-based adventure game involving a locked door, levers and dials.
#Players are to experiment with adjusting lever and dial settings.
#When players set both to the correct setting (Red and Back position, respectively)
#And the players open the door, they win.

#Problems: The player cannot exit the game from inside the game while it is running. A sentinel must be added.
#Todo: Refine the program and make it prettier/clean up code where you can.
#Remake sections of the program to furfil requirements better.

#Initialization module:
#Introduces players to the game and initializes most of the variables needed.
innerDoorLocked = True
#The following print statement clears the player's terminal, setting it up for the game.
#Future print statement like this do the same thing, to make the game appear cleaner.
