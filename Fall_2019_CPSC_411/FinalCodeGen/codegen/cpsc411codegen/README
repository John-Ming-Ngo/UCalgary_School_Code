This compiler when running it dumps the emitted wat to console. To save the output to a file execute the following:
./compiler.out <input file> > output.wat

The wat file can then be run in the same manner as any other wat file.
This mini language contains the following features
	- if
	- functions 
	- less than or equals
	- addition
	- getchar
	- putchar

The semantic checking hasn't been fully tested, so there will probably be bugs.
